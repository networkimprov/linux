0) Here's my final draft for v5; nothing new since branch -5.3, except the
   cover letter and revised commit comments. I also pulled in the
   BQ27425 chip id patch for linux-next.

1) If we need a v6, the first draft will land at anvl-v4.9-bq27x-dt-6.1

Subject: [PATCH v5 0/8] devicetree battery support and client bq27xxx_battery
To: Sebastian Reichel <sre@kernel.org>
Cc: Andrew F. Davis <afd@ti.com>, linux-pm@vger.kernel.org

Overview:
* new devicetree battery node specifies static battery data
* fuel gauge and charger nodes shall use monitored-battery=<&battery_node>
* new power_supply_get_battery_info() reads battery data from devicetree
* new struct power_supply_battery_info provides battery data to drivers
* drivers surface battery data in sysfs via related power_supply_prop_* fields
* bq27xxx driver calls the above and writes battery data to NVRAM

Changes in v5:
* incorporate feedback into Documentation/devicetree/.../battery.txt
* use power_supply_prop_* names in devicetree and power_supply_battery_info
* add battery:voltage-max-design-microvolt
* default fields to -EINVAL in power_supply_battery_info
* power_supply_get_battery_info() always looks for "monitored-battery"
* power_supply_get_battery_info() emits a warning if !psy->of_node
* squash patches for power_supply_battery_info
* bq27xxx_battery: check power_supply_battery_info values
* bq27xxx_battery: note missing power_supply_prop_* features
* bq27xxx_battery: new patch for access methods

Changes in v4:
* add "fixed-battery" compatible field to be be more consistant with devicetree

Changes in v3:
* split i2c changes into respective patches
* add documentation for battery information for fuel gauge
* rebased documentation patches on change on the list
* abstracted the battery configuration for the state machine
  to an generic struct and platform data access function

Changes in v2:
* add documentation for uWh and uAh property units
* change devicetree entries to match new property units
