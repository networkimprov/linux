0) Please review my 15 patches at the tip of this branch. I'll squash them into yours
   and submit v5 after resolving any comments and polishing the commit comments.

1) Let's version branch names to track mailing list patch versions, so this is -5.3

2) Both _battery.c and battery_i2c.c need new bq27xxx_access_methods to compile.
   This is the reason for:
   "power: bq27xxx_battery: define access methods to write chip registers"
   "power: bq27xxx_battery_i2c: drop access methods from i2c patch"

3) The comment, not the diff, is the reason for:
   "devicetree: property-units: Acks & CCs"
