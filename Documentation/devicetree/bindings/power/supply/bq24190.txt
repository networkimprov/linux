Binding for TI BQ24190 Li-Ion Battery Charger

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    * "ti,bq24190"
- reg: integer, i2c address of the device.

Optional properties:
- ti,precharge-current: integer in mA, maximum charge current during precharge
    phase (typically 20% of battery capacity);
- ti,termination-current: integer in mA, a charge cycle terminates when the
    battery voltage is above recharge threshold, and the current is below
    this setting (typically 10% of battery capacity);
- ti,minimum-sys-voltage: integer in mV, when power is connected and the battery
    is below minimum system voltage, the system will be regulated above this
    setting;

Example:

bq24190 {
        compatible = "ti,bq24190";
        reg = <0x6a>;
        // interrupt configuration here
        ti,precharge-current = <256>;
        ti,termination-current = <128>;
        ti,minimum-sys-voltage = <3200>;
};
