1) Let's version branch names to track mailing list subjects, so this is v5.3
   I created anvl-v4.9-bq27xxx-nvram-v5.3, please push next rev there.

2) Both _battery.c and battery_i2c.c need new bq27xxx_access_methods to compile.
   First squash this into _battery_i2c.c:
   "power: supply: bq27xxx_battery_i2c: drop access methods from i2c patch"
   In a second rebase pass, reorder this before _i2c.c patch (but don't squash), and edit its title:
   "power: supply: bq27xxx_battery: add access methods to _battery.c patch"

3) Squash my other commits into your patchset as appropriate.
   Note that the comment is the reason for:
   "devicetree: property-units: Acks & CCs"
