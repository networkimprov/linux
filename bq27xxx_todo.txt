BQ27xxx todo items

1) reorder & squash the commits I added to this branch into others as appropriate

2) squash the two power_supply battery_info commits; they're one conceptual unit

3) consider squashing the _battery.c & battery_i2c.c commits

4) pull over the 2 commits for devicetree property-units & bq27xxx-monitored-battery

5) set_config checks that values are in range for chip as we did here
   https://github.com/networkimprov/linux/commit/4c33a35

6) set_config requires both/neither of design_cap and design_energy to be set to prevent conflict
