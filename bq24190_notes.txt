Subject: [PATCH v1 0/7] BQ24190 support for power_supply_battery_info and DT binding
To: Sebastian Reichel <sre@kernel.org>

Overview:
BQ24190 needs settings for pre-charge & end-charge current and system min voltage to function 
correctly. Pre- and end-charge current belong in power_supply_battery_info as they are based on 
battery capacity. We add _PRECHARGE & _ENDCHARGE elements to enum power_supply_property.

Issues in v1:
* power_supply_prop_precharge & endcharge are added at end of enum to avoid sysfs breakage
* "Set bq24190-battery device .type=unknown" is a temporary workaround to be fixed in v2
