Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] BQ24190 devicetree config

Hi Sebastian, here is this series that was waiting on the power_supply_battery_info
patchset. Thanks!

Overview:
BQ24190 uses power_supply_battery_info fields for precharge & charge-termination 
current and a DT property for system min voltage. A new DT binding documents these.

Changes in v4:
* drop ifdef config_of

Changes in v3:
* clarify gpio-hog use in DT binding doc
* drop unrelated change from DT table patch

Changes in v2:
* new patch adds bq24192i to DT table
* dropped patches for power_supply precharge-current; they moved to bq27xxx series
* dropped patches for recently-applied fixes
* rebased to -next

Issues in v1:
* power_supply_prop_precharge & endcharge are added at end of enum to avoid sysfs breakage
* "Set bq24190-battery device .type=unknown" is a temporary workaround to be fixed in v2
